    <h1>Gourmet Chicken Burger</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        We all know that beef gets the spotlight when it comes to classic burgers, 
        but when it comes to alternatives, chicken burgers can get a bad rap. They 
        often get left in the dust by other choices like salmon, turkey, and veggies. 
        While they can definitely be a tad bit lean, that doesn’t mean they have to be boring! 
        We spiced up these chicken patties to ensure they definitely weren’t lacking in the flavor 
        department, before loading them up with all the must-have toppings (we’re looking at you, 
        coleslaw). If chicken burgers haven’t been your fave in the past, trust us—our easy, flavorful 
        recipe will make you a believer.
