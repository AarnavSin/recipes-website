    <h1>Chicken Biryani</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. 
        There are variations across the length and breadth of the country. There is 
        Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a 
        lot of gravy or masala and is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot. Then 
        there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser masala, but 
        packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka 
        and so many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In every single form, biryani is delicious and is almost like a one pot meal 
        that's enjoyed by families and eaten together - like a celebration!

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Prepare saffron-kewra water and chop veggies</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                To make a delightful chicken biryani dish, 
                firstly soak saffron in water to prepare saffron water (one tsp 
                saffron can be soaked in 1/4 cup water). Next, mix kewra drops in water 
                and mix well to make kewra water. Set them aside for later usage. Now, 
                chop the onion and coriander leaves and keep them aside.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Saute the onions</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Meanwhile, heat refined oil in a deep bottomed pan. 
                Once the oil is hot enough, add cumin seeds, bay leaf, 
                green cardamom, black cardamom, cloves in it, and saute for about a minute. 
                Then, add chopped onion to it and saute until pink. Now, add chicken into it 
                with slit green chillies, turmeric, salt to taste, ginger-garlic paste, red 
                chilli powder and green chilli paste. Mix well all the spices and cook for 2-3 minutes. 
                Then, add hung curd into it and give a mix. (Make sure the chicken is washed properly and 
                patted dry before adding it to the dish)
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Cook biryani on low heat for 5-6 minutes</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Turn the flame to medium again and add garam masala in it along with ginger julienned, 
                coriander and mint leaves. Add kewra water, rose water and 1 tsp saffron water in it. 
                Cook till the chicken is tender. Then add 1 cup cooked rice and spread evenly. 
                Then add the remaining saffron water and pour ghee over it. You can now cook the dish 
                without the lid or cover it with a lid to give a dum-effect due to the steam formation.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                <b>Serve hot chicken biryani with your favourite chutney or raita</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                Cook for 15-20 minutes with a closed lid and garnish with 1 tbsp 
                fried onions and coriander leaves. Serve hot chicken biryani with raita of your choice. 
                Enjoy!
