    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Biryani in India doesn't just mean biryani. 
        There are variations across the length and breadth of the country. There is 
        Hyderabadi biryani (which is what I'm sharing today) where the biryani has a 
        lot of gravy or masala and is cooked slowly with rice in a sealed pot. Then 
        there is the Muslim wedding biryani which actually has lesser masala, but 
        packed with flavour mostly from whole spices; the Kerala biryani, donne biryani from Karnataka 
        and so many more.
    </p>
    <p>
        In every single form, biryani is delicious and is almost like a one pot meal 
        that's enjoyed by families and eaten together - like a celebration!
